# Walking-to-SP
The walking algorithm for fingerprint singular points detection implemented by Matlab.
Citing paper:
    "Zhu E, Guo X, Yin J. Walking to singular points of fingerprints[J]. Pattern Recognition, 2016, 56:116-128." 
    
Note that the open souce code "MATLAB and Octave Functions for Computer Vision and Image Processing" is needed to correctly run the walking algorithm. Please download "MatlabFns.zip" from 
           http://www.peterkovesi.com/matlabfns/
and add all the folders and subfolders to the working Path.

If you are interested in this algorithm, you may refer to
